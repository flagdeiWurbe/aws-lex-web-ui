the crankcase.
3. Measure
the valve clearance between
the rocker arm
and
the valve stem using
a feeler gauge. The
standard valve clearance is 0.05 mm (0.002 in) for both intake
and exhaust valves.
4. If
the valve clearance is out of specification, loosen
the locknut
and turn
the adjuster screw until
the clearance is within specification. Then tighten
the locknut while holding
the adjuster screw in place.
5. Recheck
the valve clearance after tightening
the locknut.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for
the other valve.
7. Install
the spark plug, spark plug cap, cylinder head cover, air cleaner case, side covers, seat,
and fuel tank in reverse order of removal (see
